<h3 align="center">A passionate Full Stack Web Developer</h3>

<br/>

<div align="start">
I'm a web developer focused on crafting clean & user‚Äëfriendly experiences. I am passionate about building excellent software that improves the lives of those around me.

<br/>

I have experience working as a Full Stack Developer, primarily using **Laravel (PHP)**, **MySQL**, and **Bootstrap**, to develop dynamic and responsive web applications. I enjoy building both the backend logic and frontend interfaces, turning creative ideas into functional and user-friendly products.

<br/>

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, where I also worked on a research project focused on Deep Learning. My undergraduate thesis was published on IEEE with the title:  
<b>‚ÄúAdaptive traffic signal control system using object detection based approach‚Äù</b>.  
This research combined my interest in Artificial Intelligence and real-world problem solving.

<br/>

I love using my skills to bring creative ideas to life. I'm always eager to learn more about new technologies and trends in the web development world. I'm a firm believer in clean, maintainable code and always strive to write code that is not only functional, but also easy to read and understand.

<br/>

Thanks for reading!
